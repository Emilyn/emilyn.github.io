Hi, I'm Emilyn 👋  Welcome to my webpage !!
I'm a software engineer with a demonstrated history of working with many people arround the world.
I design, architect and build web applications and web sites.

I love working with javascript and C#. As a full time software engineer i build web applications using .net technologies and angular with azure cloud.

When i am not working i experiment lot of other software development technologies, it inspires me to develop a website so i can share my findings with others.

I enjoy outdoor adventures (🚵🏻‍♂️ 🏕 🏸), traveling, landscape photography and exploring mouth watering food 🍣 🥯 !
